## Problem Statement 
1. Create a simple 2-Page website using Node.js and SQL database, Page 1 will have three
buttons namely Fetch Users, Delete Users, User Details, on clicking the Fetch Users button the
application should fetch data from the (https://randomuser.me/) api and store it in a table of any
name in the database, the data fetch should be in bulk for e.g., if the api returns a single record
then the application should be such a way that it will fetch around 50 or 100 records on a single
click.
2. On clicking on the Delete Users button the application should remove all the entries in the
database. On clicking on the User Details the application should open the Page 2 where it will
display the data in the database as a table view with pagination feature as well as some filter
option to filter the data in the table.
